1) If you want to start check solution just copy in directory with this file custom solution with name "main.c",
then launch start_check.sh in cmd, parameters of generation, duration and quantity of tests be choosed by default.

2) If you want to set duration of runtime - launch start_check.sh with first argue means duration runtime in sec.

3) If you want to set quantity of tests - set the second argue number means quanitity of tests.

4) If you want to set max size generation on x and y coord set the third and fourth argue number of pixels on x and y.

5) If you want see all process of implementation, all result of tests, and all images which will be
generated in process program execution - just set the fifth argue in "1337", welcome to debug mode ^_^.
